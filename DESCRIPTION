Description: cavalier: Candidate Variant List Evaluation Report
    Assist and automate the with variant interpretation in next-generation sequencing data.
    1) filter list of variants and create a short list of candidate variants
    2) combine information from multiple sources useful for evaluating and prioritising variants
    3) create PDF output for visualing and communicating results
